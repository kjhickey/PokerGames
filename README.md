# PokerGames

## Information
This is a Blazor project I used to randomly generate two players poker hands using a single deck of cards. Bootstrap was used for creating the layout of the cards.

## Future Ideas
* Hand detection(a pair, two pair, three of a kind, etc..)
* Holding specific cards to redraw.
* Card flipping animation.
* Add wagering against the computer.
